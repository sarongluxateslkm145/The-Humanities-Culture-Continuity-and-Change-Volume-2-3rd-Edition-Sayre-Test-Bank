  * The Humanities: Culture, Continuity and Change, now in a third edition, has become, in a very short period of time, the best selling Introduction to Humanities text on the market. With its message of “see context and make connections across the humanities,” students enjoy countless “ah-ha” moments as they piece together the cultural history of world. Believing that students learn best by remembering stories rather than memorizing facts, author Henry Sayre employs a narrative storytelling approach to the humanities, deftly conveying multifaceted cultural experiences in a way that students can understand and will remember–throughout the course and beyond.
 
  * This third edition helps instructors and students by connecting the learning objectives in each chapter with MyArtsLab, an online learning program which brings the arts to life. Key learning tools within MyArtsLab include new listening guides for the musical selections, new Closer Look tours for every chapter entitled “Continuing Presence of the Past”, architectural panoramas and simulations to help students visualize key monuments and how they were built, and more!
